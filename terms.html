    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective date: October 28, 2025 • Contact: <a href="mailto:lockdhelp@gmail.com">lockdhelp@gmail.com</a></p>

    <p>These Terms govern your use of the LOCKD iOS app. By using LOCKD, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1) Service</h2>
    <p>LOCKD helps users build habits, track distractions, block distracting apps via Apple’s Family Controls, and maintain daily consistency. Features may evolve over time.</p>

    <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use LOCKD. If you are 13–17, you represent that you have consent from a parent or guardian where required by law.</p>

    <h2>3) Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use anonymous mode or sign in via Apple/Google.</li>
      <li>Keep your credentials secure and accurate.</li>
      <li>You may export or delete your data in-app; deletion removes your cloud data from Supabase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>Subscriptions are processed by Apple via In-App Purchases and managed in your App Store account. Prices, taxes, auto-renewal, trials, and refunds are governed by Apple’s terms and regional laws. You can cancel at any time via your iOS Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>5) Screen Time / Family Controls</h2>
    <p>App blocking relies on Apple’s Screen Time / Family Controls APIs and Device Activity. You must grant the required permissions. Some system behaviors (e.g., token expiration, OS background limits) are controlled by iOS, not LOCKD.</p>

    <h2>6) Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not misuse the app, attempt to bypass security, or interfere with others’ use.</li>
      <li>Do not use LOCKD for unlawful purposes or in prohibited jurisdictions.</li>
      <li>Provide accurate info and respect intellectual property rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The app, code, design, and content are owned by LOCKD — a product of Tuned Tech LLC — and licensed to you for personal use. You retain ownership of your content/data. All rights reserved.</p>

    <h2>8) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>LOCKD provides productivity tools “as is.” We do not guarantee outcomes, uninterrupted service, or error-free operation. Certain behaviors depend on iOS and third-party services (Apple, Supabase, SuperwallKit).</p>

    <h2>9) Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tuned Tech LLC and its owners are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, or any loss of data, revenue, or use. In no event will our aggregate liability exceed the amount you paid for the Service in the 6 months prior to the claim.</p>

    <h2>10) Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms. If changes are material, we may notify you in-app. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>11) Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the app at any time; you may also delete your account in-app. We may suspend or terminate access for violations or risks to the Service.</p>

    <h2>12) Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, USA, under which Tuned Tech LLC is registered.</p>

    <h2>13) Contact</h2>
