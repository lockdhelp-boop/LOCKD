    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective date: October 28, 2025 • Contact: <a href="mailto:lockdhelp@gmail.com">lockdhelp@gmail.com</a></p>

    <p>These Terms govern your use of the LOCKD iOS application (“Service”) operated by Tuned Tech LLC. By using LOCKD, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1) Service</h2>
    <p>LOCKD provides tools to help users build habits, track distractions, block distracting apps via Apple’s Family Controls APIs, and maintain daily consistency. Features may evolve over time.</p>

    <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use LOCKD. If you are between 13–17 years old, you represent that you have obtained consent from a parent or guardian where required by law.</p>

    <h2>3) Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may use anonymous mode or sign in via Apple or Google.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your credentials.</li>
      <li>You may export or delete your data in-app. Account deletion removes associated cloud data stored via Supabase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>Subscriptions are processed by Apple via In-App Purchases and managed in your App Store account. Pricing, taxes, free trials, renewals, cancellations, and refunds are governed by Apple’s terms and applicable regional laws. You may cancel at any time through iOS Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>5) Screen Time / Family Controls</h2>
    <p>App blocking functionality relies on Apple’s Screen Time / Family Controls APIs and Device Activity framework. Required permissions must be granted by the user. Certain system behaviors, including background execution limits or token expiration, are controlled by iOS and not by LOCKD.</p>

    <h2>6) Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not misuse the Service, attempt to bypass security measures, or interfere with its operation.</li>
      <li>Do not use LOCKD for unlawful purposes.</li>
      <li>Do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All rights, title, and interest in and to the LOCKD application, including its software, source code, design, branding, content, and related materials, are exclusively owned by Tuned Tech LLC.</p>
    <p>You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, decompile, or create derivative works without prior written consent.</p>
    <p>You retain ownership of content and data you create within the app, subject to the limited rights necessary for us to operate the Service.</p>

    <h2>8) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not guarantee specific productivity outcomes, uninterrupted service, or error-free operation.</p>
    <p>LOCKD is a productivity and behavioral support tool. It is not a medical, psychological, or therapeutic service and does not provide medical or mental health advice. If you require professional guidance, consult a qualified provider.</p>
    <p>We are not responsible for interruptions or limitations caused by iOS system behavior or third-party services including Apple, Supabase, and SuperwallKit.</p>

    <h2>9) Service Modifications</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time, with or without notice, for maintenance, updates, security, legal compliance, or business reasons.</p>

    <h2>10) Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Tuned Tech LLC and its members, affiliates, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your misuse of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>11) Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tuned Tech LLC and its members shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, revenue, or profits.</p>
    <p>In no event shall our aggregate liability exceed the amount you paid for the Service in the six (6) months preceding the claim.</p>

    <h2>12) Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms periodically. If changes are material, we may notify users in-app. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>13) Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms or risks to the Service.</p>

    <h2>14) Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, USA, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
