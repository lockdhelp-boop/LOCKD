    </ul>

    <h2>4) Third-party services</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <strong>Supabase (Backend/DB)</strong> — user auth, storage, sync • HTTPS/TLS<br/>
      <strong>Apple Services</strong> — Screen Time / Family Controls, Device Activity, Sign in with Apple, In-App Purchases, Notifications<br/>
      <strong>SuperwallKit</strong> — paywalls & subscription status (Apple handles payments)<br/>
      <strong>Analytics & Attribution Providers</strong> — we may use analytics and attribution tools (including advertising platforms) to understand app usage and measure campaign performance, subject to iOS privacy controls
    </div>

    <h2>5) Legal bases (GDPR)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contract</strong>: to provide the app/features you request</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: app security, debugging, fraud prevention, product improvement, and performance measurement</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong>: notifications; optional sign-in; and tracking/attribution where required (including via Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Data sharing</h2>

    <h2>8) Security</h2>

    <h2>9) International transfers</h2>

      <li>CCPA/CPRA: right to know, delete, and non-discrimination; and the right to opt out of “sale” or “sharing” where applicable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Request via <a href="mailto:lockdhelp@gmail.com">lockdhelp@gmail.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity.</p>

    <h2>12) Analytics & Attribution</h2>
    <p>We may use analytics and attribution tools to understand app usage, improve the Service, and measure marketing effectiveness. These tools may collect limited device and usage information such as app events (e.g., onboarding completion, trial start, subscription status), device identifiers used for attribution, and technical data (such as app version and device type).</p>
    <p>Where required, we respect Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework and your iOS privacy choices. You can control tracking permissions through iOS Settings.</p>

    <h2>13) Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy. We’ll revise the “Effective date” and may notify you in-app for significant changes.</p>
